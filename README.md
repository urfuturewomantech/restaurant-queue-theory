# Queueing Theory Implementation to Queue at a Restaurant

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Objective
Improve the effectiveness of the time it takes from the time the restaurant opens the order hours until all the customers take their orders. In addition, the purpose of this report is to fulfill the final project of the "Data Structure" course.

### Methods Used
* Queueing Theory
* Data Structure

### Language
* Python

### Module
* tabulate
* random

## Conclusion
This algorithm will arrange the most effective order based on the travel time of each buyer to the restaurant, where food will only start being prepared after the buyer arrives at the restaurant so that food quality is guaranteed. By compiling this algorithm in an application, all restaurant customers don't have to wait too long for orders.
